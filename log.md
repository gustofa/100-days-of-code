# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Before June 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: After seeing the hashtag # 100DaysOfCode on Twitter, fantasizing about doing the challenge and postponing it with the excuse of time or other things, I decided to stop putting obstacles and start.
My goal is to improve my knowledge of Javascript and CSS, and to start working with React.
I have online courses from EscuelaDevRock and Udemy, but I am also interested in working through Free Code Campâ€™s Front End Certification Projects.
I read some articles that motivated me a lot to start this challenge, I copy the links below.

**Links I read:**

### Day 1: June 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I start this challenge with some CSS, I realized that it is more complex than it seems. I learned a little about grid, box-shadow and linear-gradient.
I am missing some details to finish this calculator, tomorrow I will make it work with Javascript.

**Thoughts:** I had to do a little research to find a way to do some effects. Obviously I know less about CSS than I thought.

### Day 2: June 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I made some changes to the design of the calculator and focused on making it work with Javascript. I started alone and then used an article from freeCodeCamp. It helped me a lot to brush up on Vanilla Javascript and learn some new things.

**Thoughts:** It took longer than I thought because I had to do it with one hand, I burned the fingers of my left hand a bit today while cooking. Nothing serious, I hope tomorrow to be better and to be able to type with both hands.

### Day 3: June 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the calculator, made several changes to cover all the use cases. Then I spent two hours reviewing Javascript concepts and practicing. The quantity and quality of content that exists on the net for those who want to learn is overwhelming.
I particularly recommend the compilation of articles and videos made by Leonardo Maldonado.

**Thoughts:** I had to deal with bugs that caused malfunctions in certain cases, it was hard, but I learned to better use the browser developer tools and managed to solve the problems.

### Day 4: June 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: It was a hard day, a lot of work and little time to dedicate to the challenge. I couldn't start a new project, but I made a lot of progress with the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts:** I begin to notice the difficulty of maintaining the routine of spending several hours every day making code, and learning new things.

### Day 5: June 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the section on Grid CSS from the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification and decided to do something fun with that.
I started a Nyan Cat made only with Grid CSS! In the next few days I will make some additions.

**Thoughts:**: First I thought about making it lively, when I started I realized it was going to be quite a job just drawing it. I will do the animation in the next days.

### Day 6: June 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the drawing of Nyan Cat using Grid CSS as if they were pixels. I applied a lot of what I learned in the FreeCodeCamp lessons. I used grid-area to minimize the amount of div used, as well as overlapping divs.

### Day 7: June 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I had to spend a few hours working on friends' website. The site is in Wordpress and I had to do several things in PHP. It helped me to face very different problems than I usually do.

**Thoughts:**: PHP is not a language that I use very often, it was a nice challenge to do it and also fight with the Wordpress structure.
Not everything in life is Javascript, a large percentage of the world's websites are made in Wordpress.
