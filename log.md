# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Before June 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: After seeing the hashtag # 100DaysOfCode on Twitter, fantasizing about doing the challenge and postponing it with the excuse of time or other things, I decided to stop putting obstacles and start.
My goal is to improve my knowledge of Javascript and CSS, and to start working with React.
I have online courses from EscuelaDevRock and Udemy, but I am also interested in working through Free Code Campâ€™s Front End Certification Projects.
I read some articles that motivated me a lot to start this challenge, I copy the links below.

<!--**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to
figure out some basic functionality.-->

**Links I read:**

### Day 1: Before June 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I start this challenge with some CSS, I realized that it is more complex than it seems. I learned a little about grid, box-shadow and linear-gradient.
I am missing some details to finish this calculator, tomorrow I will make it work with Javascript.

**Thoughts:** I had to do a little research to find a way to do some effects. Obviously I know less about CSS than I thought.
